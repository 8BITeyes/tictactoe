# tictactoe

This is a project assigned by The Odin Project curriculum.

It is a basic game of tic tac toe that demonstrates the use of Immediately Invoked Function Expressions, modules and factories, and objects. This site was made with the idea of using as little global javascript as possible, with the understanding of how scope is evaluated in each object.
